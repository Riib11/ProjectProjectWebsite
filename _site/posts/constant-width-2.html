<p>Last time we introduced bodies of constant width and showed several examples, as well as hinted at constructing 3D bodies with the same symmetries as several familiar solids. This time we will discuss that method in detail and produce a number of interesting solids. All we will need is some linear algebra, group theory, and a little invariant theory.</p>

<p>We previously gave an example of a body of constant width with the support function <script type="math/tex">h(x,y,z) = 1 + xyz</script>. That was a particular example of a general method of constructing bodies of constant width using support functions of the form <script type="math/tex">h(u) = 1 + \epsilon f(u)</script>, where f is any odd function (from <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^{n}</script> to <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}</script>) and <script type="math/tex">\|\epsilon\| \gt 0</script> is sufficiently small. Notice that for odd <script type="math/tex">f</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">h(u) + h(-u) = 1 + \epsilon f(u) + 1 + \epsilon f(-u) = 2</script>

<p>So any support function like this defines a body of constant width 2. The condition on <script type="math/tex">\epsilon</script> just ensures the body is convex. (Given some odd function f, we can determine the upper bound on <script type="math/tex">\|\epsilon\|</script> such that <script type="math/tex">h(u) = 1 + \epsilon f(u)</script> defines a convex body by requiring that the triangle equality <script type="math/tex">H(x + y) \leq H(x) + H(y)</script> holds).</p>

<p>For example, say our odd function is <script type="math/tex">f(x,y,z) = x^3</script>. This gives the following body of constant width:</p>

<div class="stl-container" data-filename="/~ormsbyk/projectproject/assets/posts/constant-width-2/x3.stl">
  <div class="tip">Interactive 3D Model</div>
  <span class="loading">Loading...</span>
</div>

<p>This is nice, as there are any number of simple odd functions to choose from. However, it would be cool to construct bodies which have some chosen symmetries. How about bodies which have any choice of symmetry group (subgroups of <script type="math/tex">SO(3)</script>, i.e. orientation preserving rigid rotations in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^{3}</script>)? A theorem of Fillmore (1969) tells us that every finite subgroup of <script type="math/tex">SO(3)</script> is the group of symmetries of some body of constant width. In particular, if we choose a subgroup <script type="math/tex">G</script> and an odd function <script type="math/tex">f(u)</script> which is invariant under the action of <script type="math/tex">G</script>, then the body defined by the support function <script type="math/tex">h(u) = 1 + \epsilon f(u)</script> has the symmetries of <script type="math/tex">G</script>. The set of polynomials invariant under the actions of a given group <script type="math/tex">G</script> form a ring, any odd member of which we can use to create a <script type="math/tex">G</script>-symmetric body of constant width.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_theory">G-invariant polynomials</a> is well-developed, and mathematical software such as Sage and Magma have efficient ways to compute the ring of polynomial invariants of a given matrix group. So all we need to do is determine three-dimensional matrix representations of our favorite symmetry group. Our options include the tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral groups, among a few others–let’s focus on the octahedral group <script type="math/tex">O</script>.</p>

<p>The set of symmetries of an octahedron is the same as the symmetries of a cube, since they are dual polyhedra. Consider that there are only two actions needed to generate all the orientation preserving symmetries of the cube: rotation by 90 degrees around the <script type="math/tex">z</script> axis and rotation by 90 degrees around the <script type="math/tex">y</script> axis. These rotations act on the unit vectors (pointing to three of the faces) in the following ways:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
S = \begin{pmatrix}0&1&0  \\-1&0&0\\ 0&0&1\end{pmatrix} \\
T = \begin{pmatrix}0&0&1  \\0&1&0\\ -1&0&0\end{pmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>We will use Magma to compute the generators of the ring of polynomials invariant under O:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; F := Rationals();
&gt; S := [0,1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1];
&gt; T := [0,0,1,0,1,0,-1,0,0];
&gt; G := MatrixGroup&lt;3, F|S,T&gt;;
&gt; R := InvariantRing(G);
&gt; PrimaryInvariants(R);
[
    x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2,
    x1^4 + x2^4 + x3^4,
    x1^6 + x2^6 + x3^6
]
&gt; SecondaryInvariants(R);
[
    1,
    x1^5*x2^3*x3 - x1^5*x2*x3^3 - x1^3*x2^5*x3 + x1^3*x2*x3^5 + x1*x2^5*x3^3 -
        x1*x2^3*x3^5
]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In general, the ring of invariants <script type="math/tex">R</script> has primary invariants <script type="math/tex">f_1,...,f_m</script> which are algebraically independent. Thus the algebra of primary invariants <script type="math/tex">A = F[f_1,...,f_n]</script> is a polynomial subalgebra of <script type="math/tex">R</script>. If <script type="math/tex">g_1,...,g_n</script> are the secondary invariants of <script type="math/tex">R</script>, then there is an A-module decomposition of <script type="math/tex">R</script> as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">R \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^n Ag_n</script>

<p>Thus, to determine an F-basis all homogeneous degree <script type="math/tex">d</script> polynomials in <script type="math/tex">R</script>, we just need to enumerate all the products of primary and secondary invariants homogeneous of degree <script type="math/tex">d</script>, with the restriction that exactly one secondary invariant can appear in each product (note that the first secondary invariant is always 1, and so a product with ‘only’ primary invariants still has one secondary invariant). For example, in the above Magma computation, our invariants are:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_1 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 \\
f_2 = x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 \\
f_3 = x_1^6 + x_2^6 + x_3^6 \\
g_1 = 1 \\
g_2 =x_1^5x_2^3x_3 - x_1^5x_2x_3^3 - x_1^3x_2^5x_3 + x_1^3x_2x_3^5 + x_1x_2^5x_3^3 - x_1x_2^3x_3^5</script>

<p>Every degree 4 polynomial in the ring can be written as a linear combination of <script type="math/tex">f_1^2</script> and <script type="math/tex">f_2</script>. These happen to be linearly independent and so form a basis (writing <script type="math/tex">x_1, x_2, x_3</script> as <script type="math/tex">x, y, z</script>):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2,  x^4 + y^4 + z^4\}</script>

<p>Note that since we only really care about the behavior of these polynomials on the unit sphere, we can simplify our basis with the substitution <script type="math/tex">x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1</script>, giving us:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\{1, x^4 + y^4 + z^4\}</script>

<p>However, this particular vector space contains no polynomials we can use to create bodies of constant width, since the degree of each of them is even. The smallest odd degree polynomial vector space in this ring has degree 9 and the vector space of such elements has basis:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\{x^5 y^3 z - x^3 y^5 z - x^5 y z^3 + x y^5 z^3 +x^3 y z^5 - x y^3 z^5\}</script>

<p>Now, we can choose any polynomial in this space to define a body of constant width with octahedral symmetry. For example, the body below has support function <script type="math/tex">h = 1 + 3.2(x^5 y^3 z - x^3 y^5 z - x^5 y z^3 + x y^5 z^3 + x^3 y z^5 - x y^3 z^5)</script></p>

<p>This whole process can be repeated for any other finite subgroup of <script type="math/tex">SO(3)</script>. Below are some bodies with tetrahedral and icosahedral symmetries respectively:</p>

<p><a href="/~ormsbyk/projectproject/assets/posts/constant-width-2/gens.txt">Here’s</a> a list of the primary and secondary generators we found this way for the polynomials invariant under the groups T, O, and I.</p>

<p>With this theory laid down, it’s straightforward to compute any number of support functions of interesting bodies of constant width with these symmetries. Next time, we’ll walk through the process of realizing one of these bodies, from initial choice of symmetry to final 3D-printed product.</p>
