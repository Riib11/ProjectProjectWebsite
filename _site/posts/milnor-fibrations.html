      <h2 id="what-is-a-milnor-fibration">What is a Milnor Fibration?</h2>

<p>So now to the real meat of the topic. When you read the title of this article, you probably wondered what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnor_map">milnor fibration</a> is. Perhaps you googled it and found that wikipedia page, or maybe even this <a href="https://www.unf.edu/~ddreibel/research/milnor/milnor.pdf">pdf</a>. Together they actually give a pretty good basis for defining the subject, which is more generally a milnor map, and here I hope to give you an intuitive understanding of how particular milnor maps are constructed, and how their resulting visualizations behave.</p>

<p>First, I think it is best to define the skeleton of the construction. For my purposes, I will be restricting my attention to mappings from <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{S}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^1</script>. The comprehensive mapping looks like this:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">M : \mathbb{S}^3 \setminus K \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^1.</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\mathbb{S}^3</script> conveniently lies in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{C}^2</script>, so we can refer to <script type="math/tex">(z,w) \in\mathbb{S}^3.</script> Additionally, this <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{S}^3</script> will have radius <script type="math/tex">\epsilon,</script> which we can worry about specifying later. A particular milnor map will rely on a complex polynomial</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f = z^m - w^n,</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">w,n \in \mathbb{N}_+.</script> We will see the effects of the choice of these variables are later. Now, we should define a special set <script type="math/tex">V</script> and a relevant subset <script type="math/tex">K</script>,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">V = \left \{ (z,w) \in \mathbb{C}^2 \mid f(z,w) = 0_{\mathbb{C}} \right \};</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">K = V \cap \mathbb{S}^3</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">V</script> is just <script type="math/tex">f^{-1}(0_{\mathbb{C}})</script>, and <script type="math/tex">K</script> is the subset of <script type="math/tex">V</script> that ends up in <script type="math/tex">M</script>’s domain, if it were not removed that is. Why is it removed? Let’s look at how the Milnor map itself is defined:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">M: (z,w) \mapsto \frac{f}{\left| f \right|}.</script>

<p>Ah, <script type="math/tex">K</script> would cause problems as when <script type="math/tex">f=0</script>, <script type="math/tex">M</script> is undefined. So where are the ‘fibers’ that were mentioned in the title? And, after all, where is the visualization opportunity? It seems that <script type="math/tex">M</script> is working with a 4D input from <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{S}^3</script>, which by itself is beyond the reach of current printing technology.</p>

<p>Consider a point <script type="math/tex">\theta \in M^{-1} \subseteq \mathbb{S}^3</script>. The fibers that we want are in fact <script type="math/tex">M^{-1}(\theta)</script>. This preimage is in four dimensional <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{S}^3</script>, but we can use stereographic projection from <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{S}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3</script> to get a physical glimpse of it! Additionally, we can project <script type="math/tex">K</script> into 3D along with the fibers. <script type="math/tex">V</script> acts like a ‘binding’ for the fibered ‘pages’ that wrap around it. This kind of fibration is appropriately called an ‘open book decomposition.’</p>

<p>My models are created using the following equations as basis (a summarization of the above process):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">M_{m,n} : \mathbb{S}^3 \setminus V \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^1 := M_{m,n}(z,w) \mapsto \frac{f}{\left | f \right |}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sigma : \mathbb{S}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi : \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3 := \Phi(m,n,\theta) \mapsto \sigma \circ M_{m,n}^{-1}(\theta)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> is the appropriate stereographic projection from a sphere of radius <script type="math/tex">\epsilon</script>, and <script type="math/tex">M_{m,n}</script> denotes the specification of the polynomial <script type="math/tex">f</script> used.</p>

<h2 id="intuition">Intuition</h2>

<p>Visualizing various Milnor Fibrations involved many desicions about what in the visualization you want to emphasize. The basic sort of depiction involves would be just a single fiber. My notation for referencing a single fiber will be</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(m,n,\theta)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\theta</script> is the angle of projection and <script type="math/tex">m,n</script> are the same as in <script type="math/tex">M</script>. This is the same as the mathematical definition above. For example, the model below is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(2,3,\pi/2)</script>

<div class="stl-container" data-filename="/~ormsbyk/projectproject/assets/posts/milnor-fibrations/fiber_2-3-pidiv2.stl">
  <div class="tip">Interactive 3D Model</div>
  <span class="loading">Loading...</span>
</div>

<p>Amazing! So what would <script type="math/tex">\Phi(2,3,3\pi/4)</script> look like?</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(2,3,3\pi/4)</script>

<div class="stl-container" data-filename="/~ormsbyk/projectproject/assets/posts/milnor-fibrations/fiber_2-3-3pidiv4.stl">
  <div class="tip">Interactive 3D Model</div>
  <span class="loading">Loading...</span>
</div>

<p>Alright, there’s definitely a pattern going on here, which is what we should expect from the nature of the domain of <script type="math/tex">\Phi</script>’s <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>. The consistent structure in the middle section of the model is the complex singularity that we’ve been interested in. You may have already guessed what happens at <script type="math/tex">\theta = \pi</script>,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(2,3,\pi)</script>

<div class="stl-container" data-filename="/~ormsbyk/projectproject/assets/posts/milnor-fibrations/fiber_2-3-pi.stl">
  <div class="tip">Interactive 3D Model</div>
  <span class="loading">Loading...</span>
</div>

<p>As you can see, this fiber should stretch out to infinity, although I’ve cut it short for visual convenience. You might have to rotate and zoom this model a bit to get a good angle. As <script type="math/tex">\theta</script> progresses along, the reflected fibers will wrap around to <script type="math/tex">\Phi(3\pi/2)</script> which sits directly opposite to <script type="math/tex">\Phi(\pi/2)</script>, and then finally in <script type="math/tex">3\pi/2 \leq \theta \leq 5\pi/2 = \pi/2</script> the fibers will blend through the inside of the structure and then back to the fiber we started at.</p>

<p>All of the above fibers have a boundry on the same knot in the middle area. In the case of <script type="math/tex">\Phi(2,3,\pi/2)</script>, it turns out in fact to be a 2-3 torus knot, the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrefoilKnot.html">trefoil knot</a>. Why is this? Looking back to our mathematical definitions, we see that the fibers are in the domain of <script type="math/tex">M</script>, which is <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{S}^3 \setminus K</script>. These points in <script type="math/tex">K</script> are singular points of <script type="math/tex">M</script>, for they blow up and are not defined. So, what happens if we project <script type="math/tex">K</script> alongside a fiber, say</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(2,3,\pi/2)</script>

<div class="stl-container" data-filename="/~ormsbyk/projectproject/assets/posts/milnor-fibrations/fiber_2-3-pidiv2-withK.stl">
  <div class="tip">Interactive 3D Model</div>
  <span class="loading">Loading...</span>
</div>

<p>There’s <script type="math/tex">K</script>, right where we expected it, bordering the fiber. In this projection, I’ve actually blown up <script type="math/tex">K</script> to be a tube, but the original set <script type="math/tex">K</script> is simply a line following same path as the shown tube. If you take a close look at the feature image of this post, you can see the same tube of <script type="math/tex">K</script> knotted in the center, and the expanding, fading ‘pages’ around it are various fibers. Pretty scenic! Below is an illustration with the same parameters of the feature image, but with just the white fiber and a slightly shifted viewing angle.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/posts/milnor-fibrations/milnor-pages-half.jpg" alt="milnor pages half" /></p>

<p>Now, how can we predict how this <script type="math/tex">K</script> should look?</p>

<h2 id="theory-of-mathbbs3-setminus-k">Theory of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{S}^3 \setminus K</script></h2>

<p>There is a detailed explanation of the topology of <script type="math/tex">K</script> in Milnor’s own work <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bd6kvv">Singular points of complex hypersurfaces</a>, however I will only cover it briefly here.</p>

<p>Lets start in 4-space, the domain of <script type="math/tex">M</script>. Milnor’s Lemma 5.9 states that there exists a smooth vector field <script type="math/tex">\textbf{v}</script> on <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{D}^3 \setminus V</script> such that the inner product</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\langle \textbf{v}(z), \textnormal{grad } \log f(z) \rangle</script>

<p>is real and positive for all <script type="math/tex">z</script> and that <script type="math/tex">\langle \textbf{v}(z),z \rangle</script> has a positive real part. Next, consider the solutions to the differential equation</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dp}{dt} = \textbf{v}(p(t))</script>

<p>on the same <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{D}^3 \setminus V</script>. Following from 5.9, we can deduce that <script type="math/tex">\vert f(p(t)) \vert</script> is strictly monotone. With the condition <script type="math/tex">2\mathscr{R}\langle \frac{dp}{dt},p(t) \rangle = \frac{d\|p(t)\|^2}{dt} > 0</script>, we have a guarantee that <script type="math/tex">\|p(t)\|</script> is strictly monotone.</p>

<p>From this, we can think about starting at a point <script type="math/tex">z \in \mathbb{D}^3 \setminus V</script> and follow the appropriate path along <script type="math/tex">\textbf{v}</script> away from the origin (this direction will increase <script type="math/tex">\vert f(z) \vert</script>) until we must get to a point on the circle, <script type="math/tex">z^\prime \in \mathbb{S}^3 \setminus V</script>, for which</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{f(z^\prime)}{\vert f(z^\prime) \vert} = \frac{f(z)}{\vert f(z) \vert}.</script>

<p>Finally we have Milnor’s lemma 5.10: Let <script type="math/tex">c</script> be a small complex constant and <script type="math/tex">e^{i\theta} = \frac{c}{\vert c \vert}</script>. The intersection of the hyperplane <script type="math/tex">f^{-1}(c)</script> with an open <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{D}^3_{\epsilon}</script> is diffeomorphic to the portion of <script type="math/tex">\Phi(\theta)</script> defined by <script type="math/tex">\vert f(z) \vert > \vert c \vert</script>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if we pick a small enough <script type="math/tex">\epsilon</script>, then the concerned portion of <script type="math/tex">\Phi(\theta)</script> is actually diffeomorphic to all of <script type="math/tex">\Phi(\theta)</script>! This cements the intuition that <script type="math/tex">\Phi(\theta)</script> is basically sweeping around the boundary <script type="math/tex">f^{-1}(0) = K</script>, yielding our visuals of fibers all bounded by the same curve.</p>

<p>This work also introduces us to another variable, <script type="math/tex">\epsilon</script>. In the lemmas, Milnor uses <script type="math/tex">\epsilon</script> as the sizes of his disks. In my work, I’ve made analogous use of <script type="math/tex">\epsilon</script> as the radius of the <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{S}^3</script> that houses the fibers and provides the domain for stereographic projection. The particular <script type="math/tex">\epsilon</script> that I’ve been using is <script type="math/tex">2</script>, which was originally felt out by <a href="https://www.unf.edu/~ddreibel/research/milnor/milnor.html">Dan Dreibel</a> in his work at University of North Florida.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-of-k">Behavior of <script type="math/tex">K</script></h2>

<p>When I first started working on this project, my approach was to get a program working to produce visuals, and then to explore for some intuitive patterns in addition to reading about the theory. Now that I’ve bombared you with some theory, I’m going to (hopefully) provide you a handhold of intuition so that the theory and the visuals make mores sense together.</p>

<p>So, here’s a table of some fibers with <script type="math/tex">K</script> imbedded on them, in <strong>an</strong> order. See if you can find some patterns:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(1,1,\pi/2)</script>

  <span class="loading">Loading...</span>
</div>

<p>It turns out that <script type="math/tex">m</script> corresponds to how many times <script type="math/tex">K</script> around the one orientation of the model, and <script type="math/tex">n</script> corresponds to how many times <script type="math/tex">K</script> wraps around a perpendicular orientation. Look back to the model I presented of <script type="math/tex">\Phi(2,3,0)</script> and verify for yourself this pattern.</p>

<p>Now, what do you think <script type="math/tex">\Phi(2,2,\pi/2)</script> looks like? Make a guess and then check below.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(2,2,\pi/2)</script>

<p>Interesting! These parameters resulted in an edge that consists of two seperate paths. This composition of them is referred to as a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Link.html">link</a>, this particular one being the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HopfLink.html">Hopf link</a>. This fibration is also fun because if you draw the opposite fiber you see that <script type="math/tex">K</script> lies neatly on a 3D torus</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(2,2,3\pi/2) \cup \Phi(2,2,\pi/2)</script>

<div class="stl-container" data-filename="/~ormsbyk/projectproject/assets/posts/milnor-fibrations/fiber_2-2-pidiv2-3pidiv2-withK.stl">
  <div class="tip">Interactive 3D Model</div>
  <span class="loading">Loading...</span>
</div>

<h2 id="some-more-theory-on-k">Some more theory on <script type="math/tex">K</script></h2>

<p>So far, we’ve seen a few different varieties of edges. For example, <script type="math/tex">\Phi(1,1)</script>’s edge was an unknot (simply a circle), <script type="math/tex">\Phi(2,2)</script>’s edge was a Hopf link, and <script type="math/tex">\Phi(2,3)</script>’s edge was a trefoil knot. The total explanation of <script type="math/tex">(m,n)</script>’s correspondence to the type of <script type="math/tex">K</script> produced is the following:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">K = \left \{ (z,w) \in \mathbb{S}^1 \textnormal{ such that } \vert z \vert e^{n i \theta} - \vert w \vert e^{m i \theta + \pi i / m} = 0  \right \}</script>

<p>This is essencially a restating of the definition of <script type="math/tex">K</script> from long before, but this time we get a look at the internal workings. Following the intuition of wrapping so many times in specific directions, this deconstruction of <script type="math/tex">K</script> reveals that this is the result of coprime <script type="math/tex">m,n</script> yeilding a <script type="math/tex">(m,n)</script> torus knot of <script type="math/tex">K</script>! You can check this for youself (or read Milnor). Lets take a look at a few torus knot examples (besides the exhaustively used 2,3):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(3,4,\pi/2)</script>

<div class="stl-container" data-filename="/~ormsbyk/projectproject/assets/posts/milnor-fibrations/fiber_3-4-pidiv2-withK.stl">
  <div class="tip">Interactive 3D Model</div>
  <span class="loading">Loading...</span>
</div>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(3,5,\pi/2)</script>

<div class="stl-container" data-filename="/~ormsbyk/projectproject/assets/posts/milnor-fibrations/fiber_3-5-pidiv2-withK.stl">
  <div class="tip">Interactive 3D Model</div>
  <span class="loading">Loading...</span>
</div>

<p>All of these knots are torus knots, and the further truth is that all torus knots are expressable in this way! A corralary, all torus knots are fibered.</p>

<p>Milnor additionally explores that <script type="math/tex">m,n</script> of the form <script type="math/tex">m = mp</script> where <script type="math/tex">p</script> is prime results in <script type="math/tex">p</script> a <script type="math/tex">K</script> that has <script type="math/tex">p</script> non-singular branches, each with a link number <script type="math/tex">n</script>. This is supported by our observations with <script type="math/tex">\Phi(2,2,\pi/2)</script>, which follows with <script type="math/tex">p=1</script>. And, indeed, the resulting link has <script type="math/tex">2=m</script> branches, each with link number <script type="math/tex">1=p</script>! Great! Here are two other fun examples (the fibers get in the way so are not displayed):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi(3,6,\pi/2)</script>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope that you’ve enjoyed diving into the visualization of Milnor fibrations with me, and that you’ve learned a bit of interesting theory as well. If you are especially interested in knots, links, and the like I highly recommend <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Knots_and_Links.html?id=qFLvAAAAMAAJ">Knots and Links</a>. The section on “Fibered Knots” was especially helpful in developing a framework in which to better understand Milnor fibrations.</p>

<p>I included many visuals in this article, though they all happen to just be computer generated models. As part of Project Project, my goal was not just to create computer models, but tangible physical models as well. In my next article, <a href="/~ormsbyk/projectproject/posts/milnor-fibrations-models">Fibration Fabrication</a>, I will explain my methods and results. Be prepared for some coding as well!</p>
